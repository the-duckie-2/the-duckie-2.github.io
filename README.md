# the-duckie.github.io

Made a simple portfolio website/personal blog on a random morning while bored. Pls don't judge my lack of organization.<br>
Made using HTML, CSS, and some components from DaisyUI(via TailwindCSS).<br>
Hosted on GitHub Pages(no shit).<br>
May add some JS if I ever think of some cool stuff.<br>
