I need to change something about my life. This honestly feels like a futile waste of time, writing here, but I guess I need a creative outlet where I write my thoughts. 

I genuinely feel lost and at the same time, like I am at a major crossroads at my life. My gut tells me that I am at a similar time before 12th grade. I feel like I am about to(want to?) disappear off the face of the Earth for a very long time, until I change the circumstances of my life completely. The last year and a half has been the most painful of my life. JEE, her, December, and everything else in between was extremely painful. My luck seems to have become a bit better since March/April? I found a great group of friends, trained my lungs to failure, started going to the gym, did a lot of wild stuff. 
However, I feel like a new season is about to start. Maybe I am manifesting it? Maybe. However, my gut tells me something is about to happen. 
It's 4:30 am in the middle of the night, and I have spent the last few days contemplating life decisions. Maybe I have accumulated enough dad lore for college. I need to moneymaxx, because if I don't, I will regret these decisions my whole life. Get into the whole job rut, and be stuck in that position forever.
But more than anything, I have lost feelings for her, I am not interested in talking to anybody, I want to go off the grid again, fuck off from everywhere for a few months, and come back a completely new person, and this is the absolute best time I can do this. Quit smoking and all the other stuff. Quit ig. Quit girls. Quit everything which doesn't contribute to the end. I have had my fun, and done everything I didn't get to do in high school and JEE. Loneliness and lack of friends? Solved. GF? Solved(maybe way too much). Being sick and depressed? Solved. To the extent, that I don't feel anything anymore after the breakup. Nothing really makes me sad, but nothing makes me happy either. I just feel anger/rage or guilt/fear of the future. 
I need to quit smoking, quit pot. I have already quit alcohol. I don't feel like smoking anymore, but the problem is my friends offering me cigs, which I need to prevent from happening. I need to stop putting myself in positions where I end up going to a party or a hangout where they are smoking cigs. Anyone offers a cig? Deny. Anyone asks me to tag along with them for a cig? Say no. Say no to anything that might have anything to do even remotely to cigs/pot. Come to MT? No. Wanna smoke with me? Nah. A party or a car ride? Nah. A hangout to smoke? Nah. Anything which has anything to do even remotely with cigs? Say no.

Apart from quitting cigs and pot, and leaving ig and girls, I also need to figure out what to work on. I need to get that fire back I have always had. That fire has never ever left me. And it never will. 
I have learnt the best way to think and introspect for me is to hold an internal dialogue, where I keep asking myself questions which are vague and open-ended, and I am allowed to respond however I want to that question and go off on a tangent. I feel that is better than just writing stuff.

I am facing an existential crisis right now, where I am thinking as to what the purpose of my life is. Why am I doing any of this stuff? Why not just give up? Why not just retire as a monk? I honestly believe there is no deeper answer than, I want to. I believe I am destined for something great. And I cannot let this opportunity slip. I want to be God. I want to be untouchable. I want to be operating at a level beyond anyone here today. And I have a mission. To put a dent in the universe. I think to figure out who you are as a person, instead of directly attacking the problem and trying to figure out what you want to do directly, you should look at your beliefs, dreams, ideal future, heroes, favourite stories, and opinions on a variety of things. External meaning does not exist, as your destiny and fate are determined by your actions solely and your beliefs. You might assign an external reason, such as God telling you to do something, to yourself as your life's purpose, but tracing back the logic behind that(or lack thereof) reveals that you did that because of your upbringing and beliefs. This is why white Americans join the j!had. They are raised in circumstances which attracts them to Islam, and their painful circumstances may make them puritanical and rigorous with everyone. They may finally find companionship there which they never had. They may believe in their desperation that God will save them from their present circumstances. 
Similarly, if I want to figure out my end goal/purpose in life, I need to look at my past, and what I believe in. 

My path in life in the near future is clear. I know exactly what I need to work on for the next year. Moneymaxx and gymmaxx. But in the longer run, what do I need to do, and why do I need to do that? I am aware that in the longer run, I will need an independent source of money so that I am not dependent on a job for money, and neither am I stuck doing work I do not like forever, and have the ability to do whatever I want, from wherever I want and whenever I want, so I need to moneymaxx, and I need to gymmaxx for obvious reasons.

And this is what I am going to focus on for the next year. I am disappearing for a while, and I won't return until I am satisfied with where I am.

As I leave, the most important thing I think you should take away from this, no matter when or where you read this is this. 

You always know what you need to be doing at any given point in time. You are smart enough to know exactly what you should be doing or working on at any given point in time. And you know that what you need to be doing is correct. 
All you need to do is realise that this is what I need to do, and STICK TO IT. If you think you need to do something, then say that I will do this, or conversely I will not do this. 
AND STICK TO YOUR WORD. STAND BY YOUR WORDS. DO WHAT YOU PROMISE TO DO. FULFILL YOUR OBLIGATIONS.

That is literally the only thing you need to do in life. That is it. That is all you need to do, forever. That is the great secret of the universe.

We start today.
