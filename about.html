    <p>As you have already seen on the homepage, my name is Daksh. I am 19 and an undergrad in the Physics department at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.</p> 
    <p>I am interested in a wide range of things, including, but not limited to, software dev, pure math, physics, swimming, quizzing, books and playing videogames.</p>
    <p>I live in Bengaluru, India. I am very interested in hard-tech, as it combines some of the things I love the most, coding, applied math, physics and (some?)videogames(I absolutely LOVE AoE2 and HOI4).</p>
    <br>

    <h2 style="margin: 20px; font-size: 25px; color: #0d6b26;">Academic interests:</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><b style="color: #192473;">1. Full-stack Dev:</b> I am working on building an AI wrapper SaaS application right now, using Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the foundational model. I am still very much a beginner and learning about how to implement RAG to optimize my application.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Along with this, I am learning Golang right now for my back-end, along with Docker and Kubernetes. This website is the first project I have worked on in my pursuit of learning webdev. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><b style="color: #192473;">2. Human Space Settlements:</b> Though I am pursuing Physics as my major and am currently interested in software development, my true interest lies in human space settlements.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;">I have always been fascinated with space and it's exploration, as is seen in my choice of books(Isaac Asimov's The Foundation Trilogy happens to be my favourite book series). I had also authored a paper in 2020 on the feasibility of humans establishing a free space settlement in the Lagrangian points around the Martian orbit for the NASA Ames Space Settlement Contest, where I came second globally. The one achievement I am proudest of.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px; color: #192473;"><a href="files_docs/Gaia(26).docx" style="color: #72076E;" class="link">Link here for those interested.</a></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><b style="color: #192473;">3. Nuclear Fusion:</b> The children yearn for the reactors. Energy is inversely proportional to human problems. Build more nuclear reactors.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><b style="color: #192473;">4. Terraforming and climate change: </b>We need more land for more people and to obtain more resources. The Australian desert has more surface area than Pluto. Just saying. Also, experience in terraforming Australia wil help us in our mission of terraforming Mars, which will give us a permanent secondary home base. Very helpful in the event of [list all possible threats to humanity]. I also want to work on electric planes because why not? Helps against climate change, reduces oil dependency, may be feasible with advances in battery technology(Lithium-ion batteries and ultracapacitors, along with the use of magnetrons for offboard power supply via microwaves is something I intend to write a paper on some day in the near future).</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><b style="color: #192473;">5. History and Geopolitics: </b>Sounds edgy, but I am a major history buff, especially of ancient Rome, Greece and the modern era post-WW1(especially WW2, you can AMA about this and I could go on a 30 minute long tangent). I also like sociology(with an emphasis on economic causes and mathematical sociology, again something which is emphasized upon by Asimov. Reading the future using the past is possible with math) and linguistics. I also like geopolitics and how it all connects together. I basically like the tea of global politics and how it might affect our future and which warlord might become rich in the future. Sociology, the past and geopolitics determine the future of countries so yea. Seems fun. This may have something to do with my liking for war, strategy and videogames which revolve around these two.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 15px; color: #72076E;">(Holy fuck, all of this sounds so fucking gay. I mean, I like this shit but still sounds gay speaking this out loud.)</p>
    <br>
    <h2 style="margin: 20px; font-size: 25px; color: #0d6b26;">Non-academic interests:</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><b style="color: #192473;">1. Books:</b> Hopefully, I should have added another tab on this page detailing the books I have read thus far, the books I have on my reading list right now, and a way for yall to drop book recs</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><b style="color: #192473;">2. Videogames: </b>I like videogames a ton. Strategy games mostly, with the occasional open-world game. I don't really like FPS games ngl. HOI4, AOE2 come under strategy, GTAV, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands, Minecraft and all those under open-world. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><b style="color: #192473;">3. Gym: </b>I like getting jacked. I like the endorphins. I like the pain. Summarizes this pretty well. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><b style="color: #192473;">4. Quizzing: </b>I have always been abnormally good at this, despite the lack of effort I have put into this. I should write about this sometime in more detail. I have won a few national-level quizzes and made a fuckton of money from these. Great way to make money, makes me think and feel smart when I solve a question. Fun, but it's not really the highest priority right now for me. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><b style="color: #192473;">5. Music: </b>How the fuck did I forget music? I listen to this shit 24x7 and curate endless playlists based on mood and genre, and yet, I forgot to add this here. I absolutely love music(listening to it, not creating it. My mother eternally resents me not having finished through with learning the guitar after doing it for 4 years in high school). I am listening to a LOT of rap of late, but I like emo, gay music as well. My taste in music is across a pretty broad spectrum of genres, ranging from early 2000's rap, to whatever the fuck Current Joys is, to Punjabi rap and Russian war music.</p>
